# Source characterization submodule

The CF source characterization submodule receives the input data from the user and calculates available excess heat. It has 6 main functions (outflow_simplified, generate_process, generate_boiler, generate_burner generate_cooling_equipment and generate_chp), and 5 auxiliary functions (schedule_hour; T_flue_gas; combustion_mass_flows; compute_flow_rate and stream). These are the main functionalities to analyse user data input for sources.
