Welcome to EMB3RS - Core Functionalities's documentation!
=========================================================

This manual describes one of the modules of the tool created within the Horizon 2020 EMB3RS project:
the Core Functionalities (CF) module. The module is responsible for the characterization of sources (suppliers fo excess heat) and sinks (consumers
of heat). Moreover, performs internal heat recovery simulations to the sources - Pinch Analysis and ORC design and assesses the technologies to connect both sinks and sources to a possible District Heating Network (DHN).

The EMB3RS project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
program under grant agreement No 847121. This module is part of a larger assessment toolbox called
‘EMB3RS platform’. More information on the EMB3RS project can be found at https://www.emb3rs.eu/ .
