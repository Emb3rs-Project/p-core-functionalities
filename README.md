The Core Functionalities module will allow a full characterization of the main objects of the EMB3Rs platform and simulation process, e.g. sinks, sources and links. For sources, the CF module is divided into 2 submodules: characterization and simulation.

The CF source characterization submodule receives the input data from the user and calculates available excess heat. It has 4 main functions (outflow_simplified, generate_process, generate_boiler and generate_chp), and 5 auxiliary functions (schedule_hour; T_flue_gas; combustion_mass_flows; compute_flow_rate and stream) which are fully described elsewhere (deliverables 2.1 and 3.1).
